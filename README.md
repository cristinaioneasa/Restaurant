# Restaurant
Implementation of a food delivery management system for a restaurant in Java.

### Objectives
The application is designed for three distinct user types: administrators, clients, and employees (cooks). The objectives of the application are as follows:
#### For clients:
This type of user can view a complete list of products and apply various filters such as product name, price, calorie count, rating, protein, fat, and sodium content. Additionally, the customer can place an order through the application.

The "Employee" user can only view when a customer places a new order.

#### For administrators:
The "Administrator" user has advanced capabilities, such as importing an initial list of products from an Excel file and modifying the list by adding, updating, or deleting products. Furthermore, the administrator can generate various types of reports based on specified time intervals, products ordered a certain number of times, loyal customers, and products ordered on a particular day.
